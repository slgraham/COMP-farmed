A jupyter notebook with a python script that calculates how much COMP you've farmed to date.

## How to run

1. Install the required python libraries with [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/)

```
~ poetry install
```

You can also install them directly if you'd prefer:

```
~ pip install dotenv web3
```

2. Copy `local.env` to `env` and replace the key with your own

3. Replace `my_address` with your wallet address.

4. Run the notebook to see how much COMP you've farmed!
